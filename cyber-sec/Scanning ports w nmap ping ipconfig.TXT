Identify servers on a network (windows)
ipconfig /all

Check if a server is up and running
ping [ip-address]

e.g. ping 10.7.1.22

Ping multiple ports:
nmap -sP [ip-address]

Typically with websites port 80 and port 443 are open.

Be aware that nmap is not discreet. You can practice on any server you own or have permission to scan. e.g. scanme.nmap.org
Use -sS option for stealthy scan. Works by doing incomplete handshakes to establish if a port is open. This helps avoid firewalls detecting suspicious activity.
Not specifying a port scans the top 1000 most popular ports

Many options with nmap such as OS detection. -A. -D for decoy ip addresses.
use nmap scripts. To run all scripts under category vuln use nmap --script vuln
